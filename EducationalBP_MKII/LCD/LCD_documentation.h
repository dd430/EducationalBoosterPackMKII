/// @brief      Documentation for the LCD_screen Library Suite
/// @details Additional documentation on coordinates, fonts and colours
///
/// @n  The LCD_screen Library Suite is the continuation of the [Serial_LCD Library Suite](http://embeddedcomputing.weebly.com/serial_lcd-library-suite-for-4d-systems-screens.html).
/// The Serial_LCD Library Suite is now obsolete and no longer maintained. 4D Systems has launched a new series of screens and provides the libraries for the new serial SPE2 protocol, which is not compatible with former SGC serial protocol.
/// While Serial_LCD Library Suite was limited to 4D Systems screens in SGC mode, the LCD_screen Library Suite adresses a larger audience of basic screens, with a variety of sizes, connections and features.
